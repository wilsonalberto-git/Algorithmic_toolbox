# Algorithmic_toolbox

In this repository contains the list of exercises that I developed in the Algorithm Toolboox course. This course was given by UC San Diego (in an online format with Coursera). This repo is divided in four parts:

1. Algorithmic Warm-up

2. Greedy Algorithms

2. Divide & Conquer

3. Dynamic Programming
